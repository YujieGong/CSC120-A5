- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
I feel like it will make me think about the relationship between classes, like how should they be connected with each other. It makes me feeling very accomplished when I put everypart of the body together. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Most of parts of my code works properlly, but when I type java Scarecrow "Happy fall, everyone!" into the console, instead of the double quotation mark, only single quotation mark works, so that is something I should work on.
